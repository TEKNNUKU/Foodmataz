# Foodmataz
This platform aims to connect local sellers of fresh food items, such as those found in markets and restaurants, with customers who are nearby. Sellers can create profiles on the platform and list the items they have available for sale and their prices, similar to a menu. Customers can browse these offerings and add items to their cart, placing an order which is then prepared by the seller and collected by a nearby carrier for delivery to the customer's destination. The platform uses location proximity to match sellers and carriers with buyers, and allows sellers to specify a delivery range to ensure efficient fulfillment of orders. It also provides tracking for both sellers and buyers to keep them informed of the status and estimated arrival time of their orders. The platform aims to make it easy for buyers to access a variety of local products and for sellers to expand their customer base beyond their immediate location, while also providing a convenient and efficient delivery service.
